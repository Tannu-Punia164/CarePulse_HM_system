# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Doctor Appointment System (Frontend)
A user-friendly frontend application for a Doctor Appointment System, enabling users to efficiently find, view profiles of, and schedule appointments with doctors based on their specific needs and availability.

## About the Project

This project serves as the interactive frontend for a comprehensive Doctor Appointment System. Its primary goal is to streamline the process of booking medical appointments. Users can browse through a directory of available doctors, view their detailed profiles (including specialization, qualifications, and availability), and then proceed to schedule appointments based on their medical requirements (e.g., General Physician, Gynecologist) and preferred dates and time slots.

The backend for this system is currently under development and will be integrated in a future phase.

## Features

* **Doctor Search & Browse:** Users can search and browse a list of available doctors.
* **Doctor Profiles:** View detailed profiles for each doctor, including their specialization.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Users can book appointments based on:
    * Doctor specialization (e.g., Gynecologist, General Physician).
    * Preferred date.
    * Available time slots.
* **User-Centric Design:** Focus on an intuitive and smooth user experience for appointment booking.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a rapid development environment.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* **HTML & CSS:** Standard web technologies for structuring content and styling.
* **JSX:** A syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React to describe UI.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this frontend application up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn (alternative package manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
   
    git clone(https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
  
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
   
    cd your-repo-name/frontend
  
3.  **Install dependencies:**
   
    npm install
    # OR if you prefer yarn:
     yarn install


### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    
    npm run dev
    # OR if you prefer yarn:
    yarn dev
  
2.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Future Plans

* Integration with the backend API for full functionality (user authentication, actual appointment booking, data persistence).
* Implementation of user dashboards to manage appointments.
* Adding more advanced search and filtering options for doctors.
